                                        A thorough understanding of the systemic circuit requires at least a basic understanding of your entire circulatory system. Your circulatory system consists of your heart, which is a muscular, four-chambered pump, and a series of closed tubes - your blood vessels - that carry blood away from your heart, deliver it to all of your tissues, and then return it to your heart.

The blood vessels that carry blood away from your heart are called the arteries. To help you remember this, think 'a' for 'away,' like 'a' for 'artery.' As they travel farther from your heart, your arteries divide into progressively smaller vessels called arterioles, which themselves divide into even smaller vessels called capillaries. It is within your capillaries that oxygen and nutrients are delivered to your tissues, and carbon dioxide and cellular waste products are picked up.

Once your capillaries have delivered oxygen to your tissues and gathered up the carbon dioxide from your cells, they join into progressively larger vessels called venules, which join into even larger veins as they course toward your heart. Eventually, your veins return the blood that has traveled throughout your body to your heart. So, don't forget: arteries carry your blood away from your heart, and veins carry your blood back to your heart.
