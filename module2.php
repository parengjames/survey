                        Your metabolism is the sum of the physical and chemical processes in your body needed to sustain
                        life by producing energy. In humans, metabolism involves a large number of different organs and
                        tissues. For this reason, the word metabolic is frequently used in medicine, nutrition, and
                        other health sciences to discuss the digestive system, circulatory system, and other bodily
                        processes.

                        Example: While studying the birds, the researchers conducted intense studies of the animals’
                        metabolic rate increases during prolonged flights. </span> </span> waste products have to be

                keeps the blood moving through the vessels. The normal adult heart pumps about 5 liters of blood every
                minute throughout life. If it loses its pumping <b style="color: blue;"> effectiveness </b> for even a

                        four chambers of the heart. The
                        heart is comprised of two atria and two ventricles. Blood enters the heart through the two atria
                        and exits through the two ventricles. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the
                        inferior and superior vena cava. The right side of the heart then pumps this deoxygenated blood
                        into the pulmonary arteries around the lungs. There, fresh oxygen enters the blood stream, and
                        the blood moves to the left side of the heart, where it is then pumped to the rest of the body.
                        There is a major difference between the heart of a developing fetus and that of a fully mature
                        adult: a fetus will have a hole in the right atrium. This allows blood to flow straight through
                        to the left atrium. This is significantly important to a fetus’ circulatory health. While in the
                        womb, the fetus draws oxygenated blood from its mother. Once born, lungs become necessary and
                        the connection between the two atria closes.</span></span>

                        other areas of the heart. The walls of the left atrium are slightly thicker than the walls of
                        the right atrium. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs enters the left atrium through the pulmonary
                        vein. The blood is then pumped into the left ventricle chamber of the heart through the mitral
                        valve. From there, the blood is ready to be pumped into the body to deliver oxygen-rich blood to
                        all bodily tissues. Mitral valve prolapse is a common affliction in which the mitral valve
                        between the left atrium and left ventricle does not close properly. This condition does not
                        typically require treatment; however, some patients with mitral valve prolapse can develop more
                        serious conditions that require treatment. One such condition is mitral valve regurgitation, in
                        which blood leaks back into the left atrium through the mitral valve.</span></span>

                        pressure in the heart increases. The changes make it harder for the heart to effectively pump

                        pulmonary circuit is the path of circulation between the heart and the lungs. Blood is pumped to
                        the various places of the body by a process known as the cardiac cycle. Oxygen depleted blood
                        returns from the body to the right atrium of the heart by two large veins called vena cavae.
                        Electrical impulses produced by cardiac conduction cause the heart to contract. As a result,
                        blood in the right atrium is pumped to the right ventricle. On the next heart beat, the
                        contraction of the right ventricle sends the oxygen-depleted blood to the lungs via the
                        pulmonary artery. This artery branches into left and right pulmonary arteries. In the lungs,
                        carbon dioxide in the blood is exchanged for oxygen at lung alveoli. Alveoli are small air sacs
                        that are coated with a moist film that dissolves air. As a result, gases can diffuse across the
                        thin endothelium of the alveoli sacs. The now oxygen-rich blood is transported back to the heart
                        by the pulmonary veins. The pulmonary circuit is completed when pulmonary veins return blood to
                        the left atrium of the heart. When the heart contracts again, this blood is pumped from the left
                        atrium to the left ventricle and later to systemic circulation.</span></span>

                transports blood to and from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and delivers carbon dioxide for

                        thorough understanding of the systemic circuit requires at least a basic understanding of your
                        entire circulatory system. Your circulatory system consists of your heart, which is a muscular,
                        four-chambered pump, and a series of closed tubes - your blood vessels - that carry blood away
                        from your heart, deliver it to all of your tissues, and then return it to your heart. The blood
                        vessels that carry blood away from your heart are called the arteries. To help you remember
                        this, think 'a' for 'away,' like 'a' for 'artery.' As they travel farther from your heart, your
                        arteries divide into progressively smaller vessels called arterioles, which themselves divide
                        into even smaller vessels called capillaries. It is within your capillaries that oxygen and
                        nutrients are delivered to your tissues, and carbon dioxide and cellular waste products are
                        picked up. Once your capillaries have delivered oxygen to your tissues and gathered up the
                        carbon dioxide from your cells, they join into progressively larger vessels called venules,
                        which join into even larger veins as they course toward your heart. Eventually, your veins
                        return the blood that has traveled throughout your body to your heart. So, don't forget:
                        arteries carry your blood away from your heart, and veins carry your blood back to your
                        heart.</span></span>

                        lungs. Some authors refer to this vessel as the main pulmonary artery, or simply the pulmonary
                        artery. The pulmonary trunk arises from the base of the right ventricle of the heart. After
                        passing behind the ascending aorta, it splits up into the left and right pulmonary arteries to
                        provide blood for oxygenation in the lungs.</span></span>

                        pulmonary arteries are blood vessels that carry systemic venous blood returning to the right
                        side of the heart through to the microcirculation of the lungs. Unlike in other organs where
                        arteries supply oxygenated blood, the blood carried by the pulmonary arteries is deoxygenated,
                        as it is venous blood returning to the heart.</span></span>

                These vessels in turn branch many times before reaching the <span class="card-box"

                        pulmonary capillaries are the junction points between the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary
                        veins. They are microscopic vessels in which red blood Blood is composed of red cells, white
                        cells, platelets and plasma. Red cells carry oxygen and carbon dioxide. White cells are our

                where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters. The pulmonary trunk
                arteries and their branches are the only arteries in the body that carry relatively deoxygenated blood.
                Highly oxygenated blood returning from the pulmonary capillaries in the lungs passes through a series of
                vessels that join together to form the </span></span>

                    <span class="card-popup " style='font-size:16px;'> The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer
                        oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The largest pulmonary veins are the four main
                        pulmonary veins, two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart.</span></span>

                the only veins in the body that carry highly oxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins bring blood into the
                left atrium, which delivers the blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into
                the aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit. Eventually, these vessels will lead to
                the systemic capillaries, where exchange with the tissue fluid and cells of the body occurs. In this
                case, oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic
                processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the blood.</span></span>

                        superior vena cava (SVC) is a large, significant vein responsible for returning deoxygenated
                        blood collected from the body to the right atrium. It is present within the superior and middle
                        mediastinum. The superior vena cava handles the venous return of blood from structures located
                        superior to the diaphragm. In contrast, its counterpart, the inferior vena cava, handles venous
                        return from the portion of the body inferior to the diaphragm. The impedance of flow in the
                        superior vena cava by thrombosis or external compression can cause hemodynamic compromise
                        depending on the severity and acuity of the obstruction.</span></span>

                        inferior vena cava (also known as IVC or the posterior vena cava) is a large vein that carries
                        blood from the torso and lower body to the right side of the heart. From there the blood is
                        pumped to the lungs to get oxygen before going to the left side of the heart to be pumped back
                        out to the body.

                        The IVC gets its name from its structure and location. It is the lower, or inferior, part of the
                        vena cava, which transports blood back to the right side of the heart. The IVC carries blood
                        from the lower body while another vein, known as the superior vena cava, returns blood from the
                        upper half of the body to the heart.</span></span>

                return blood to the right atrium. The blood in the superior and inferior venae cavae flows into the
                right atrium, which delivers blood into the right ventricle. This process of blood circulation continues
                as long as the individual remains alive. (Figure).

                                The endocardium is a delicate layer that invests the entire inner surface of the heart.
                                Its structure and thickness are very variable from one chamber to another, and even
                                within different regions of a given chamber. The endocardial connective tissue is
                                continuous with that in the myocardial interstitium and valvular leaflets. Endocardium
                                is thicker in the atria than in the ventricles, in the left- than in the corresponding

                                ventricles. The ventricular endocardium is composed of five distinct layers: the
                                endothelial layer, the inner connective tissue layer, the elastic tissue layer, the
                                smooth muscle cell layer, and the outer connective tissue layer or subendocardial

                                The myocardium is the muscular layer of the heart. It consists of cardiac muscle cells
                                (cardiac myocytes [also known as cardiac rhabdomyocytes] or cardiomyocytes) arranged in
                                overlapping spiral patterns. These sheets of cells are anchored to the fibrous skeleton
                                of the heart, which surrounds the atrioventricular valves and the origins of the aorta
                                and pulmonary artery. The myocardial thickness is related to the pressure present in
                                each chamber; thus the atria are thin walled and the ventricles are thicker. In adult
                                animals, the thickness of the left ventricular free wall is approximately threefold that
                                of the right ventricle, measured in a transverse section across the middle of the
                                ventricles, because the pressure is greater in the systemic circulation than in the
                                pulmonary circuit.</span></span>

                        vessels that supply the myocardium and the nerve fibers that help regulate the heart. It is the
                        contraction of the myocardium that pumps blood through the heart and into the major
                        arteries.</span></span>

                                blood.</span></span>

                        is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle. In order to overcome the
                        high resistance required to pump blood into the long body circuit, the left ventricle must
                        generate a great amount of pressure. The right ventricle does not need to generate as much
                        pressure, since the route to and from the lungs is shorter and provides less resistance. [link]

                            is approximately the size of your fist. Given the size difference between most members of
                            the sexes, the weight of a female heart is smaller on average than the male's heart. The

                            considerably larger than this. Cardiac muscle responds to exercise in a manner similar to
                            that of skeletal muscle. Hearts of athletes can pump blood more effectively at lower rates

                                        The pericardium is a thin sac that surrounds your heart. It protects and
                                        lubricates your heart and keeps it in place within your chest.

                                        Problems can occur when the pericardium becomes enflamed or fills with fluid.
                                        The swelling can damage your heart and affect its function.</span></span>

                                        The pericardial cavity is the potential space formed between the two layers of
                                        serous pericardium around the heart. Normally, it contains a small amount of
                                        serous fluid that acts to reduce surface tension and lubricate. Therefore, the
                                        cavity facilitates the free movement of the heart.</span></span>

                                The dorsal surface of the heart lies near the bodies of the vertebrae, and its anterior
                                surface sits deep to the sternum. The great veins, the superior and inferior venae
                                cavae, and the great arteries, the aorta and pulmonary trunk, are attached to the
                                superior surface of the heart, called the base.Figure. The inferior tip of the heart is
                                called the apex.</span></span>
