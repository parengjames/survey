                        been called a fluid “tissue,” because like solid tissues it contains several types of cells
                        which perform complex functions for the human body.</span></span> to all the tissues in the

                        Oxygen is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas essential to living organisms, being taken up
                        by animals, which convert it to carbon dioxide; plants, in turn, utilize carbon dioxide as a
                        source of carbon and return the oxygen to the atmosphere. Oxygen forms compounds by reaction
                        with practically any other element, as well as by reactions that displace elements from their
                        combinations with each other; in many cases, these processes are accompanied by the evolution of
                        heat and light and in such cases are called combustions. Its most important compound is

                        describes something that
                        is related to or is affected by
                        metabolism, as in Dr. Petrov discovered the patient’s illness had metabolic causes.

                        Your metabolism is the sum of the physical and chemical processes in your body needed to sustain
                        life by producing energy. In humans, metabolism involves a large number of different organs and
                        tissues. For this reason, the word metabolic is frequently used in medicine, nutrition, and
                        other health sciences to discuss the digestive system, circulatory system, and other bodily
                        processes.

                        Example: While studying the birds, the researchers conducted intense studies of the animals’
                        metabolic rate increases during prolonged flights. </span> </span> waste products have to be
                removed. Deprived of these necessities, cells soon undergo irreversible changes that lead to death.
                While blood is the transport medium, the heart is the <span class="card-box"> organ <span
                        class="card-popup" style='font-size:16px;'> Organs are the structures formed by a group of
                        tissues. The human body
                        organs of different types and can be grouped into sections like Of Digestion: Esophagus,
                        Stomach, liver, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. Of Respiration:
                        Lungs, nose, trachea, bronchi. Circulation: Heart, blood vessels, spleen. </span></span> that
                keeps the blood moving through the vessels. The normal adult heart pumps about 5 liters of blood every
                minute throughout life. If it loses its pumping <b style="color: blue;"> effectiveness </b> for even a
                few minutes, the individual's life is jeopardized.

                        heart is comprised of two atria and two ventricles. Blood enters the heart through the two atria
                        and exits through the two ventricles. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the
                        inferior and superior vena cava. The right side of the heart then pumps this deoxygenated blood
                        into the pulmonary arteries around the lungs. There, fresh oxygen enters the blood stream, and
                        the blood moves to the left side of the heart, where it is then pumped to the rest of the body.
                        There is a major difference between the heart of a developing fetus and that of a fully mature
                        adult: a fetus will have a hole in the right atrium. This allows blood to flow straight through
                        to the left atrium. This is significantly important to a fetus’ circulatory health. While in the
                        womb, the fetus draws oxygenated blood from its mother. Once born, lungs become necessary and
                        the connection between the two atria closes.</span></span>

                        four chambers of the heart, located on the left posterior side. Its primary roles are to act as
                        a holding chamber for blood returning from the lungs and to act as a pump to transport blood to
                        other areas of the heart. The walls of the left atrium are slightly thicker than the walls of
                        the right atrium. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs enters the left atrium through the pulmonary
                        vein. The blood is then pumped into the left ventricle chamber of the heart through the mitral
                        valve. From there, the blood is ready to be pumped into the body to deliver oxygen-rich blood to
                        all bodily tissues. Mitral valve prolapse is a common affliction in which the mitral valve
                        between the left atrium and left ventricle does not close properly. This condition does not
                        typically require treatment; however, some patients with mitral valve prolapse can develop more
                        serious conditions that require treatment. One such condition is mitral valve regurgitation, in
                        which blood leaks back into the left atrium through the mitral valve.</span></span>

                        pressure in the heart increases. The changes make it harder for the heart to effectively pump

                            Figure 2: Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, where it is
                            pumped into the pulmonary circuit. The blood in the pulmonary artery branches is
                            low in oxygen but relatively high in carbon dioxide. Gas exchange occurs in the
                            pulmonary capillaries (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out), and blood
                            high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium. From
                            here, blood enters the left ventricle, which pumps it into the systemic circuit.
                            Following exchange in the systemic capillaries (oxygen and nutrients out of the
                            capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), blood returns to the right atrium
                            and the cycle is repeated.</p>

                                The epicardium develops from a protrusion of mesenchymal cells covered by mesothelium,
                                the pro-epicardial organ (Simões and Riley 2018). This structure arises from the
                                pericardial surface in the region of the sinus venosus during postfertilization week 5.
                                The pro-epicardial cells migrate on the surface of the heart both by proliferation from
                                their original location and by local directional outgrowth. The pro-epicardial cells
                                successively spread over the myocardial surface of the developing atria,
                                atrioventricular canal, ventricles and the proximal part of the outflow tract. The
                                remnants of the pro-epicardium can be found in the area of the developing systemic
                                venous tributaries up to stage 15 before it ultimately regresses.

                                The myocardium is the muscular layer of the heart. It consists of cardiac muscle cells
                                (cardiac myocytes [also known as cardiac rhabdomyocytes] or cardiomyocytes) arranged in
                                overlapping spiral patterns. These sheets of cells are anchored to the fibrous skeleton
                                of the heart, which surrounds the atrioventricular valves and the origins of the aorta
                                and pulmonary artery. The myocardial thickness is related to the pressure present in
                                each chamber; thus the atria are thin walled and the ventricles are thicker. In adult
                                animals, the thickness of the left ventricular free wall is approximately threefold that
                                of the right ventricle, measured in a transverse section across the middle of the
                                ventricles, because the pressure is greater in the systemic circulation than in the

                                The endocardium is a delicate layer that invests the entire inner surface of the heart.
                                Its structure and thickness are very variable from one chamber to another, and even
                                within different regions of a given chamber. The endocardial connective tissue is
                                continuous with that in the myocardial interstitium and valvular leaflets. Endocardium
                                is thicker in the atria than in the ventricles, in the left- than in the corresponding
                                right-sided chambers, and in the outflow tracts than in the inflow tracts of the
                                ventricles. The ventricular endocardium is composed of five distinct layers: the
                                endothelial layer, the inner connective tissue layer, the elastic tissue layer, the
                                smooth muscle cell layer, and the outer connective tissue layer or subendocardial

                                The right atrium is one of the four chambers of the heart. The heart is comprised of two
                                atria and two ventricles. Blood enters the heart through the two atria and exits through
                                the two ventricles. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the inferior and
                                superior vena cava. The right side of the heart then pumps this deoxygenated blood into
                                the pulmonary arteries around the lungs. There, fresh oxygen enters the blood stream,
                                and the blood moves to the left side of the heart, where it is then pumped to the rest
                                of the body. There is a major difference between the heart of a developing fetus and
                                that of a fully mature adult: a fetus will have a hole in the right atrium. This allows
                                blood to flow straight through to the left atrium. This is significantly important to a
                                fetus’ circulatory health. While in the womb, the fetus draws oxygenated blood from its
                                mother. Once born, lungs become necessary and the connection between the two atria
                                closes.</span></span>

                        is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle. In order to overcome the
                        high resistance required to pump blood into the long body circuit, the left ventricle must
                        generate a great amount of pressure. The right ventricle does not need to generate as much
                        pressure, since the route to and from the lungs is shorter and provides less resistance. [link]

                            rather broad at the superior surface and tapering to the apex (see Figure). A typical heart
                            is approximately the size of your fist. Given the size difference between most members of
                            the sexes, the weight of a female heart is smaller on average than the male's heart. The
                            heart of a well-trained athlete, especially one specializing in aerobic sports, can be
                            considerably larger than this. Cardiac muscle responds to exercise in a manner similar to
                            that of skeletal muscle. Hearts of athletes can pump blood more effectively at lower rates
                            than those of nonathletes.

                                        that of a fully mature adult: a fetus will have a hole in the right atrium. This
                                        allows
                                        blood to flow straight through to the left atrium. This is significantly
                                        important to a
                                        fetus’ circulatory health. While in the womb, the fetus draws oxygenated blood
                                        from its
                                        mother. Once born, lungs become necessary and the connection between the two
                                        atria
                                        closes.</span></span>

                                is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle. In order to
                                overcome the
                                high resistance required to pump blood into the long body circuit, the left ventricle
                                must
                                generate a great amount of pressure. The right ventricle does not need to generate as
                                much
                                pressure, since the route to and from the lungs is shorter and provides less resistance.

                                            The heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially
                                            between the lungs in the mediastinum. It is about the size of a
