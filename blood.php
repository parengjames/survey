                                        Blood is the body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers the essential materials for life to the body’s cells. It has sometimes been called a fluid “tissue,” because like solid tissues it contains several types of cells which perform complex functions for the human body.

                                    The components of blood are produced mainly in the bone marrow, where special cells produce red cells, white cells, and platelets. So-called “blood cancers” such as leukemia are actually cancers of the bone marrow. As cancerous tissue replaces healthy bone marrow tissue, healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets cannot be made.

                                    Despite looking like a simple red fluid, blood is as complex as any tissue in the body. Here we will discuss its functions, its components, and some clinically important characteristics of blood.
